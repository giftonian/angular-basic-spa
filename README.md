# TourOfHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.7.

## Development server

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
- `ng g c component-name` is shortcut to above command

## Build

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
- `ng build --prod` for a production ready build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Help
- The `*ngFor` is Angular's repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list.
- **Services** are like middleman where you can implement your logic about data fetching. These services are then passed to component classes as a ***Dependency Injection*** because many classes/compenents can use these shared services.
- `ng g s service-name` to generate a new service.
